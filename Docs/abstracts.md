## Authors
[Your Name] - Biomedical/Electronic Engineering

## Location
Mozambique, 2024

## Problem Statement
Falls are a leading cause of injury and mortality among the elderly population, especially in low-resource settings where continuous monitoring is unavailable.

## Solution
An affordable, Arduino-based system that detects falls using a tilt sensor and provides immediate visual/auditory alerts to caregivers.

## Key Features
1. **Real-time fall detection** using tilt switch
2. **Dual alert system**: Visual (LED) + Auditory (buzzer)
3. **State-based logic** with automatic reset
4. **Low-cost components** (~$15 USD)
5. **Easy deployment** in home settings

## Technical Specifications
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Uno
- **Detection Method**: Tilt switch position sensing
- **Alert Delay**: <100ms response time
- **Power**: USB 5V or battery
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 continuous operation

## Applications
- Elderly care facilities
- Home healthcare monitoring
- Post-operative patient supervision
- Disability assistance devices

## Impact
- Reduces fall-related injuries
- Provides peace of mind for families
- Lowers healthcare costs
- Demonstrates affordable medical technology in Mozambique
