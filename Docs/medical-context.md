# MEDICAL CONTEXT & APPLICATIONS

## The Fall Problem in Healthcare

### Statistics:
- 1 in 3 adults over 65 falls each year
- Falls are the leading cause of fatal injury in elderly
- 20-30% of falls cause moderate to severe injuries
- Healthcare costs from falls exceed $50 billion annually

### Risk Factors:
- Balance disorders
- Muscle weakness
- Medication side effects
- Environmental hazards

## System's Medical Relevance

### Prevention vs Detection:
- **Prevention**: Environmental modifications, exercise programs
- **Detection**: Immediate response to minimize injury consequences

### Clinical Applications:

#### 1. Home Care Settings
- Monitors elderly living alone
- Alerts family members/caregivers
- Provides safety assurance

#### 2. Hospital Wards
- Monitors high-risk patients
- Reduces nurse workload
- Prevents unattended falls

#### 3. Rehabilitation Centers
- Tracks patient mobility
- Provides safety during exercises
- Records fall incidents for analysis

#### 4. Nursing Homes
- 24/7 monitoring capability
- Multiple units for different residents
- Cost-effective solution

## Alert Protocol

### Immediate Response Requirements:
- **Detection Time**: <1 second
- **Alert Method**: Visual + Auditory
- **Alert Duration**: Continuous until reset
- **Reset Method**: Return to upright position

### Caregiver Actions:
1. **Hear/See Alert** → Immediate response
2. **Check Patient** → Assess injury
3. **Provide Assistance** → Help to safe position
4. **Document Incident** → For medical records

## Future Enhancements
- Wireless alert transmission
- Mobile app notifications
- Fall severity classification
- Integration with emergency services
